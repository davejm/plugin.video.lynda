# plugin.video.lynda
An XBMC / Kodi addon that allows the user to watch Lynda.com courses.

# Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy the folder 'plugin.video.lynda' to your XBMC / Kodi addons directory (Linux is usually ~/.kodi/addons and Windows is usually somewhere in %APPDATA%\kodi\addons).

# Notes

Currently the only supported account login type is 'Organisational' but I hope to implement functionality to login 'normal' Lynda.com accounts as well.
